A simple CRM plugin for lead capture and contact management within WordPress.

== Description ==

CRM packages for WordPress often fall into one of two categories:
* You have to pay a monthly fee to use a service behind it
* It’s too complex to use inside of WordPress

CRM for WordPress was built with ease-of-use and reasonable costs for the small and medium business that uses WordPress for their site.  CRM for WordPress allows you to:
* Capture and manage leads
* Collect contact information
* (COMING SOON) Manage a full sales funnel
* (COMING SOON) Integrate with major marketing automation services, such as MailChimp, Aweber and more
* (COMING SOON) Integrate with major form providers, such as Gravity Forms, Contact Form 7 and more
* (COMING SOON) Integrate with major shopping cart providers, such as WooCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads and more

CRM for WordPress allows users to add clients, suppliers or opportunities. You have the ability to add notes to each client and also to assign reminders. You can sort by category (client, supplier, opportunity), and within this an extra field in opportunity allowing you to give each opportunity a value (ready to buy, looking for quotes, buying 6 months, first contact and no longer interested). These values will be listed when you sort by opportunities. You are also able to assign more than 1 address details or you can add a secondary contact to each record.

CRM for WordPress allows you to keep your data in your WordPress site.  It will allow you to eventually synchronize data across your services (COMING SOON).

We’ve just taken over the plugin as the previous author had abandoned it.  All reviews from Oct 2015 and beyond are current with the new version of the plugin.  If you haven’t used it in awhile because it wasn’t being updated, come on back and give it another try.  We have a lot planned for CRM for WordPress!
